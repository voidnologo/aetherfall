# Consistency Rules

Rules for maintaining visual cohesion across generation sessions and the full
art production pipeline. This is the enforcement layer — refer to it before
generating any new art.

---

## Rule 1: Always Reference Before Generating

Before creating any new art, read the following documents in order:

1. `style-guide.md` — What the art should look like
2. `prompt-engineering/prompt-templates.md` — How to construct prompts
3. `prompt-engineering/generation-settings.md` — Technical parameters
4. `prompt-engineering/negative-prompts.md` — What to avoid

Do not generate from memory or assumption. The documents are the source of truth.

## Rule 2: Style Discipline

> Updated Session 34: the locked direction is **D — Deco Lithograph** (see `style-guide.md`).

**Hard rules:**
- **Lithograph palette only.** Midnight, bone, soot, Aether cyan, Galvanic amber, oxblood. Palette-snap in post if generation drifts.
- **Cyan means the Aether; amber means the Engine.** Never swap them, and never use them as generic decoration.
- **Flat shapes.** No airbrush gradients, photographic lighting, or 3D rendering.
- **No text in images.** Crop or inpaint any lettering or signatures; never put character names in prompts.
- **1920s-analog period accuracy.** Clothing, technology, and architecture must be era-appropriate unless a specific setting reason overrides.

**Verification:** Compare each piece against the approved golden set (to be chosen from round 2) for palette, value structure, and level of simplification.

---

## Rule 3: Style Consistency Checklist

Every accepted piece must pass ALL of these checks:

- [ ] Linework quality — clear, confident pen strokes visible throughout
- [ ] Lithograph palette only; cyan = Aether, amber = Engine
- [ ] Flat shapes, crisp edges, no airbrush or 3D look
- [ ] Art Nouveau/Deco decorative elements consistent with established set
- [ ] 1920s period accuracy in clothing, tech, and architecture
- [ ] No digital smoothness — the piece looks hand-drawn, not rendered
- [ ] Consistent level of detail with existing accepted pieces
- [ ] Composition serves its intended function (spot, plate, portrait, etc.)
- [ ] No text, watermarks, or generation artifacts
- [ ] Anatomy acceptable (hands, faces, proportions)
- [ ] Silhouette clear at reproduction size

If a piece fails 2 or more checks, reject and regenerate.

## Rule 4: Character Design Locks

Once a character portrait is approved, the following are **locked** and must
not change in subsequent art featuring that character:

- **Face structure** (bone structure, scars, eye treatment)
- **Hair** (style, length)
- **Signature clothing** (silhouette-defining garments)
- **Signature weapons/equipment** (type, design)
- **Body proportions** (height, build)
- **Distinguishing marks** (magical markers, tattoos, scars)

Use IP-Adapter with the approved portrait as reference for consistency.
If a subsequent generation drifts from locked elements, regenerate.

**Creature design locks** are softer — creatures are supernatural and can
vary somewhat between appearances, but core identifying features (number of
eyes, body plan, scale) must remain consistent.

---

## Rule 5: Prompt Versioning

When modifying a prompt:
1. Note the change and reason in the prompt file
2. Keep the old version (comment it out or move to a "Previous Versions" section)
3. Re-run the quality checklist on new results
4. Update the generation log with the new prompt

Never modify a prompt without recording what changed and why.

---

## Rule 6: Generation Logging

Every generation session must be logged. Create or append to
`docs/art/generation-log.md`:

```markdown
## [Date] — [Session Description]

### [Piece Name]
- **Art type:** [character / creature / equipment / location / decorative / spot / plate]
- **Model:** flux_dev / flux_schnell / etc.
- **LoRA:** lineart:0.75, sketch:0.45, bw:0.35
- **Seed:** 847293651
- **CFG:** 3.5
- **Steps:** 30
- **Resolution:** 832 x 1216
- **Prompt:** (paste or reference the prompt file + modifications)
- **Post-processing:** Threshold: 145, upscaled 2x, manual hand cleanup
- **Result:** Accepted / Rejected (reason)
- **File:** assets/generated/finals/characters/scholarly-caster.png
- **Notes:** Observations about what worked or didn't
```

## Rule 7: Batch Consistency

When generating multiple pieces in one session:

1. **Use the same model and LoRA stack** for the entire batch
2. **Use the same CFG and steps** across the batch
3. **Generate all pieces of one type before switching types** — this maintains
   visual consistency within categories
4. **Compare each new piece against the golden reference set** before accepting
5. If you change any parameter mid-batch, note it in the log and re-evaluate
   earlier pieces

---

## Rule 8: Quality Tiers

Not all art needs the same polish level:

| Tier | Art Types | Generation | Iteration |
|------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **S-tier** | Full-page plates, key character portraits | flux_dev, 35 steps | 5-10 generations, extensive post-processing |
| **A-tier** | Major creatures, location vignettes | flux_dev, 25-30 steps | 3-5 generations |
| **B-tier** | Equipment studies, minor characters, spots | flux_dev, 25 steps | 2-3 generations |
| **C-tier** | Decorative borders, dividers, simple spots | flux_schnell for testing, flux_dev for finals | 1-2 generations |

---

## Rule 9: Cross-Session Continuity

**When starting a new art generation session:**

1. Read this document first
2. Read `docs/continuation-prompt.md` for project context
3. Read `docs/art/generation-log.md` to see what's been done
4. Load approved reference pieces for visual comparison
5. Check for any parameter adjustments noted in the log
6. Continue from where the last session left off

**When ending a session:**

1. Update the generation log with everything generated
2. Note any parameter adjustments that worked well
3. Note any style drift concerns
4. Update `docs/continuation-prompt.md` with art pipeline status

---

## Rule 10: Style Evolution (Controlled)

The art style may evolve as the project develops. This is allowed but controlled:

- **Minor adjustments** (LoRA strength tweaks, prompt wording) — any time, just log
- **Significant changes** (new LoRA, different model, different line quality) —
  re-evaluate all previously accepted art for consistency
- **If more than 5 pieces need regeneration** due to a change, treat it as a
  full art reset and regenerate from the golden reference set

Evolution, not revolution. Small tracked changes that compound into improvement.

---

## Rule 11: Reference Art vs. Original Art

The existing art in `art/` (cat, dragon, fantasy figure) is **reference art only** —
it establishes the visual tone and aesthetic direction but is not original to this
project and may have copyright restrictions.

- **Use as mood/style reference** — these pieces demonstrate the desired line quality,
  crosshatching approach, and decorative sensibility
- **Do not use in final publications** — all published art must be originally generated
- **Do not use as IP-Adapter source** — generate original reference pieces instead
- **The golden reference set** (Phase 1 approved originals) replaces these as the
  authoritative style anchors once it exists
