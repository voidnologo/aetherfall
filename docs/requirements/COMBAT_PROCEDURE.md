# Combat Procedure

## Document Status: DRAFT — Playtest Ready
**Last Updated:** 2026-03-31

This is the unified combat reference. It pulls together mechanics from PROJECT_SPEC.md (timing track, weapons, armor, death spiral), MAGIC_SYSTEM.md (casting, backlash, exhaustion), and FIREARMS_EQUIPMENT.md (malfunction, accumulation) into a single step-by-step procedure.

---

## 1. Starting Combat

When a situation turns violent — or when timing and sequencing matter — the GM calls for the timing track.

1. **GM sets the scene.** Describe the environment, distances (close / near / far — see §8), lighting, cover. Players and NPCs declare their current state (weapon drawn? spell ready? hands full?).
2. **Place the marker at count 0.** This is the timing track's starting point.
3. **Everyone declares their first action simultaneously.** Players state what they're doing; GM decides for NPCs. No one has seen anyone else act yet — you're reacting to the situation, not to each other.
4. **Place tokens.** Each participant places a token on the count when their action will **complete** (current count + action's speed). A character drawing a weapon (speed 2) from count 0 places their token at count 2.
5. **Advance the track.** The GM moves the marker forward count by count. When it reaches a token, that action resolves.

### Simultaneous Resolution

If multiple tokens land on the same count, resolve in this order:
1. **Whoever started their action first** resolves first.
2. If actions started on the same count, resolve **simultaneously** — both attacks land, both spells fire. Neither reacts to the other.

### Declaration Order

When multiple characters need to declare new actions on the same count (after their previous actions resolved simultaneously), they declare in order of **PC (Physical Coordination), lowest first.** Ties broken by **AW (Awareness), lowest first.** If still tied, simultaneous declaration.

This means faster, more perceptive characters **declare last** — they see what slower opponents are committing to before choosing their own action. This is a significant tactical advantage and a reason to invest in PC and AW.

*Example: Kael (PC +2, AW +1) and a thug (PC +0, AW -1) both resolve at count 5. The thug declares first (PC +0). He's pulling a knife. Kael sees this and declares his response — maybe he draws his sword, maybe he takes a step back and draws his revolver. The thug is committed; Kael gets to react.*

### Cancelling an Action

A character can abandon their current action at any time before it resolves. They immediately declare a new action, but it costs **+1 count penalty** added to the new action's speed. The counts already spent on the cancelled action are lost.

*Example: You declared a Heavy weapon swing (speed 7) at count 0, token at 7. At count 3, you see a caster beginning a spell. You cancel the swing (3 counts lost) and declare a Small weapon quick strike (speed 2 + 1 penalty = 3). New token at count 6.*

---

## 2. Actions in Combat

### 2.1 Attack (Melee)

**Skill:** Melee (PC-based) for weapons, Brawl (PC-based) for unarmed.

**Speed:** Per weapon category (see weapon tables below).

**Procedure:**
1. Declare attack and target.
2. Place token at current count + weapon speed.
3. When token resolves: roll d100 against your skill target number.
4. **Hit:** Roll equal to or under your target number → proceed to damage (§4).
5. **Miss:** Roll over your target number → the attack misses. Action spent.
6. **Critical hit:** Roll within your crit range → double damage dice before adding modifiers.
7. **Critical miss (00):** Weapon fumble — GM adjudicates (dropped weapon, off-balance, hit an ally, etc.).

### 2.2 Attack (Ranged — Martial)

**Skill:** Ranged (PP-based).

**Speed:** Per weapon category. Bows can fire again immediately; crossbows require reload time.

**Procedure:** Same as melee, plus:
- **Range modifiers:** Close range: no modifier. Near range: no modifier. Far range: -10% to hit (unless weapon has the Accurate tag).
- **Firing into melee:** -10% to hit. On a miss within the penalty range, the shot hits the nearest ally in the melee (GM adjudicates).
- **Reload:** After spending all Capacity, the weapon requires its Reload speed in counts before firing again. Place a reload token; when it resolves, the weapon is ready.

### 2.3 Attack (Firearms)

**Skill:** Ranged (PP-based).

**Speed:** Per firearm category. Same procedure as ranged attacks, plus:

**Malfunction check** — required when:
- Magic Accumulation is present in the area, OR
- The weapon is an exotic, OR
- The GM calls for it (damaged weapon, adverse conditions).

If a malfunction check is required, roll d100 **alongside your attack roll** (or use the same roll — see sidebar). If the result is **over** the weapon's current effective Reliability, the weapon malfunctions:
- The shot does not fire. Timing counts are spent.
- Roll d10 on the Malfunction Severity table (§6).

> **Sidebar — One Roll or Two?** For speed of play, you can use the attack roll itself as the malfunction check. If you roll over your skill target, you miss. If you *also* rolled over the weapon's effective Reliability, it's a malfunction instead of a clean miss. If you hit (rolled under skill) but rolled over Reliability, the shot fires *and* the weapon malfunctions after — it worked this time, but something's wrong. This keeps the rhythm fast: one roll, two thresholds.

**Effective Reliability** = Base Reliability − (Magic Accumulation × 3)

**Ammo tracking:** Each shot (or burst for Burst-tagged weapons) consumes ammo from Capacity. When empty, reload.

### 2.4 Cast a Spell

**Skill:** Casting target number (see MAGIC_SYSTEM.md).

**Speed:** Fixed per spell. Each spell has a single casting time regardless of tier. Tier measures how much power the caster draws, not how long it takes — a bigger effect doesn't take more time, just more energy. Casting time is a per-spell balancing lever: Force is fast (3 counts), Sever is slow (8 counts), Mend is in between (5 counts).

**Procedure:**
1. Declare the spell. Place token at current count + the spell's casting time.
2. When token resolves: roll d100 against your casting target number.
3. Determine tier achieved based on roll margin (1-10 under = Weak, 11-30 = Standard, 31-50 = Strong, 51+ = Spectacular).
4. **Scholarly casters** feel the surge and choose: accept the tier rolled, or **restrict down** to any lower tier. Want to save exhaustion? Take Weak even though you rolled Strong.
5. **Wild casters** ride the wave — they get what they get. The magic gives and you take it. No choice, no restriction.
6. Apply the spell's effect at the final tier.
7. Pay exhaustion cost for the tier used (deduct from EP).
8. Roll backlash check — percentage chance based on tier (Weak 5%, Standard 10%, Strong 15%, Spectacular 25%). On failure: 1d4 physical damage + 25% chance of Wild Effect.
9. Apply Magic Accumulation to the area (Weak +1, Standard +2, Strong +3, Spectacular +4).

> **Design Note:** Fixed casting times mean wild and scholarly casters follow the same timing rules. The difference is purely what happens at resolution — control vs. chaos. A wild caster throwing Force might get a Weak puff or a Spectacular blast; the casting *time* is the same either way. This also makes spell design cleaner: a spell's casting time is an independent balance lever from its tier effects.

**Spell cancellation:** Cancel mid-cast at any time before resolution. Pay **half the Weak tier's exhaustion cost** for that spell. 10% chance of backlash (1d4 damage). Fixed, predictable, easy to remember — the narrative is that some power was already flowing when you cut it off.

**Casting interruption:** If a caster takes damage while casting (between declaration and resolution), they must make a **concentration check**: roll d100 under their (PW + 4) × 10. Failure means the spell fizzles — treat as cancellation (half Weak tier cost, 10% backlash chance). The caster may choose to voluntarily abort instead of rolling.

> **PLAYTEST NOTE:** Concentration check mechanics are provisional. (PW + 4) × 10 means a PW +2 caster needs to roll under 20 — concentration is hard under fire. This may need tuning. Should damage amount affect the check? For now, keep it simple: any damage = one check, flat target.

### 2.5 Defend (Active Defense)

A character who is **not currently mid-action** (no token on the track, or their token already resolved this count) can attempt to actively defend against an incoming attack.

**Skill:** Melee, Brawl, or Athletics (defender's choice based on how they describe the defense — parrying with a weapon, ducking, diving aside).

**Procedure:**
1. Attacker hits (rolls under their skill target).
2. Defender declares active defense.
3. **Opposed check:** Defender rolls d100 against their chosen defense skill. Compare margins — attacker's hit margin vs. defender's defense margin. Larger margin wins.
4. **Defender wins:** Attack is deflected, dodged, or parried. No damage.
5. **Attacker wins:** Attack lands normally. Proceed to damage.
6. **Both fail:** This can't happen (attacker already hit). If the defender fails their roll, the attack lands.

**Cost:** Active defense consumes your **next action's timing.** Add +2 counts to your next declared action (you're recovering from the dodge/parry). If you have no pending action, you're free to act normally on your next turn but you still take the +2 penalty on whatever you declare.

**Restrictions:**
- You can only actively defend **once per count.** Multiple attackers on the same count means you pick one to defend against.
- You cannot actively defend while mid-action (token on the track, not yet resolved). You committed — you're swinging, reloading, casting. You can't also dodge. Cancel your action first (with the +1 penalty), then defend.
- The **Parrying** weapon tag gives +10% to your defense roll when using Melee to defend.
- Shields add their Soak to passive damage reduction (§4) — they don't require an active defense roll. But a character *can* actively defend with a shield using Athletics, representing a deliberate block.

> **Design Note:** Active defense is a tradeoff. It can save you from a big hit, but it costs you tempo on the timing track. Defender-heavy play slows you down; aggressor-heavy play means eating hits. This mirrors real combat and the OSR ethos — don't get hit in the first place by controlling the fight.

---

## 3. The Attack Roll

All attacks use the same resolution: **d100 roll-under** against the relevant combat skill target number.

**Skill target number:** ((10 + stat modifier) × skill level) + 30

**Modifiers** (cumulative):

| Situation | Modifier |
|-----------|----------|
| Target in cover (partial) | -10% |
| Target in heavy cover | -20% |
| Target prone (melee) | +10% |
| Target prone (ranged) | -10% |
| Firing into melee | -10% |
| Far range (ranged/firearms) | -10% |
| Aimed shot (spend +2 speed) | +10% |
| Wound penalty (Harmed) | -10% |
| Wound penalty (Maimed) | -25% |
| Wound penalty (Incapacitated) | -50% |
| Exhaustion penalty | Stacks with wound penalty |
| Hinder (armor) | -per-point to physical skill rolls (see §5) |

**Critical hits:** Double all damage dice before adding flat modifiers. Crit range = 1 point per 25% of skill rating, counted down from skill value.

**Critical miss (00):** Always misses. GM describes a fumble — dropped weapon, stumble, friendly fire, broken string, jammed mechanism.

---

## 4. Damage & Soak

When an attack hits:

### Step 1 — Roll Damage
Roll the weapon's damage dice. On a critical hit, double the dice (not flat modifiers).

### Step 2 — Apply Armor Soak
Subtract the target's armor Soak value from the damage. Shields are added to armor Soak (worn armor + held shield = total Soak).

**Minimum damage:** If Soak reduces damage to 0 or below, the attack is absorbed. No damage dealt.

### Step 3 — Apply Remaining Damage to HP
Subtract remaining damage from the target's current HP. Track which wound tier they've entered (see §5).

### Step 4 — Check Armor Degradation
If the raw damage (before soak) **exceeded** the armor's Soak value, the armor takes a hit. Roll d100:
- **25 or under:** Armor's Soak is **permanently reduced by 1.**
- **Over 25:** Armor holds. No degradation.

One check per hit that exceeds Soak. Simple, no math — did the blow punch through? 25% chance something cracked.

*Example: Chainmail (Soak 5) takes 8 raw damage. Damage exceeded Soak, so roll degradation. Rolls 14 — degradation. Chainmail drops from Soak 5 to Soak 4. Still functional, but wearing down.*

> **Crushing tag:** Degradation chance is **50%** instead of 25%. Maces, warhammers, and morning stars wreck armor. Roll 50 or under = lose 1 Soak.

> **Piercing tag:** Ignores 2 points of armor Soak. Effective Soak is reduced by 2 for damage calculation (not for degradation — the armor is bypassed, not damaged).

> **Design Note:** Simulation tested over 10 hits: chainmail vs. a medium melee weapon averages Soak 3.6/5 (degrades but survives the fight). Vs. a revolver, averages 3.0/5 (firearms noticeably wear it down). Half plate vs. a rifle averages 6.1/8 (heavy armor holds up but takes chips). Light armor against weapons that outclass it still crumbles fast — leather vs. a short sword is 58% destroyed after 10 hits. The right armor for the right threat matters.

## 5. Wounds & the Death Spiral

### 5.1 Hit Points & Wound Tiers

**HP per tier:** 7 + PP

A character has four wound tiers. Each tier is a separate HP pool of equal size. Damage fills them top to bottom.

| Tier | Status | Penalty | Condition |
|------|--------|---------|-----------|
| 1 | OK | None | Full fighting capacity |
| 2 | Harmed | -10% to all rolls | Bloodied, bruised, hurting |
| 3 | Maimed | -25% to all rolls | Serious injury, visibly wounded |
| 4 | Incapacitated | -50% to all rolls | Barely functional, one hit from death |

**Beyond Incapacitated:** When a character takes damage that would reduce them below 0 HP in the Incapacitated tier → **death saves** (see §5.3).

### 5.2 Stacking Penalties

Wound penalties and exhaustion penalties **stack.**

| Wound | Exhaustion | Total Penalty |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| Harmed (-10%) | OK | -10% |
| Harmed (-10%) | Weakened (-10%) | -20% |
| Maimed (-25%) | Weakened (-10%) | -35% |
| Maimed (-25%) | Severely Weak (-25%) | -50% |

At -50%, your skill target of 60 becomes 30. You're rolling to succeed at all, not rolling to do well. This is the death spiral working as intended — getting hurt makes you worse, which makes you more likely to get hurt again. The lesson: don't get hit.

### 5.3 Death Saves

When reduced past Incapacitated, the character is **Dying.** They collapse and cannot act.

**Every 3 counts** on the timing track, they roll d100:
- **Under 50:** Holding on. Still dying, but stable this check.
- **Over 50:** Condition worsens. After **3 failed rolls**, the character dies.
- **01:** Stabilize — no longer dying, but unconscious at 0 HP in the Incapacitated tier.
- **00:** Dead immediately.

The fastest possible death is **9 counts** (three checks, three failures). That's enough time for an ally to cancel their current action, sprint to you, and attempt first aid — tight, but possible. More typical: 12-18 counts of dying before death, giving the party a realistic window to intervene.

**Ally intervention:**
- **Medicine check** (speed 5): Success stabilizes the dying character. They're unconscious at 0 HP Incapacitated.
- **Mend spell:** Healing restores HP normally. If it pushes them above 0 in Incapacitated, they regain consciousness. Remember: casting Mend takes time on the timing track and generates Magic Accumulation.
- **Healing potion** (speed 3, must be in hand): Force-fed to the dying character. Restores HP per potion strength.

> **Design intent:** Death should be possible but not instant. The 3-count interval gives allies a genuine rescue window — they might need to cancel an action (+1 penalty), sprint (3 counts), and apply Medicine (5 counts) = roughly 9-10 counts. That's a close race against the death clock, which is exactly the tension we want. The flat 50/50 is intentionally simple — it may evolve into something tied to PP after playtesting.

### 5.4 Hinder

Armor with a **Hinder** value imposes penalties to physical actions:

- **-5% per Hinder point** to rolls using PC (Coordination), Athletics, Stealth, and Swimming.
- **+1 speed per Hinder point** to all spellcasting (the encumbrance disrupts somatic components and concentration).
- Hinder does **not** affect Melee, Brawl, Ranged, PP-based rolls, or mental/social skills.

| Armor | Hinder | Effect |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Half Plate | 1 | -5% to agility skills, +1 casting speed |
| Full Plate | 2 | -10% to agility skills, +2 casting speed |
| Kite Shield | 1 | -5% to agility skills, +1 casting speed |
| Knight Shield | 2 | -10% to agility skills, +2 casting speed |

Hinder from armor and shield **stacks.** Full Plate + Knight Shield = Hinder 4 (-20% agility, +4 casting speed). You're a walking fortress that casts slowly.

---

## 6. Malfunction Checks (Firearms in Combat)

### 6.1 When to Check

Roll a malfunction check on every shot/burst when:
- **Any** Magic Accumulation is present in the area, OR
- The weapon is an **exotic** (always), OR
- The **GM calls for it** (weapon damaged, adverse conditions).

In a clean environment with zero accumulation, conventional firearms do **not** require malfunction checks. They just work.

### 6.2 The Check

Roll d100. Over the weapon's effective Reliability = malfunction.

**Effective Reliability** = Base Reliability − (Magic Accumulation × 3)

At effective Reliability 0 or below, the weapon does not function. No roll needed.

### 6.3 Malfunction Severity

On malfunction, the shot does not fire (action wasted). Then roll d10:

| d10 | Result | Effect |
|-----|--------|--------|
| 1-5 | **Click** | Nothing additional. Weapon is fine, just didn't fire |
| 6-7 | **Jam** | Clearing takes the weapon's full Reload time in counts |
| 8 | **Misfire** | Round goes somewhere unintended. GM determines where |
| 9 | **Mechanical Failure** | Weapon non-functional until repaired (out of combat, Repair check) |
| 10 | **Catastrophic** | Weapon destroyed. Wielder takes 1d6 damage |

**Exotic escalation:** Exotic weapons add +1 to the d10 severity roll (max 10).

### 6.4 Accumulation in Combat

Track Magic Accumulation as spells are cast during the fight. Each spell adds accumulation equal to its achieved tier (Weak +1, Standard +2, Strong +3, Spectacular +4). This accumulation persists — it stacks through the fight and decays at 1 per minute after casting stops.

In a fight with active casters, firearms become progressively less reliable as the scene goes on. Smart fighters act early with firearms and switch to melee as accumulation climbs.

---

## 7. Spell Interruption in Combat

Spells take time on the timing track. Between declaration and resolution, a caster is **vulnerable.**

### 7.1 Interrupting a Cast

If a caster takes **any damage** while their casting token is on the track (not yet resolved), they must make a concentration check:

**Roll d100 under (PW + 4) × 10.**

- **Success:** Spell continues. Resolves normally when the token is reached.
- **Failure:** Spell fizzles. Treat as cancellation — pay half the Weak tier's exhaustion cost, 10% chance of backlash.

The caster can **voluntarily abort** instead of rolling concentration, taking the cancellation costs.

### 7.2 Tactical Implications

- Fast weapons (Small melee: speed 2, Holdout pistol: speed 2) can interrupt casters before big spells resolve.
- Slow spells (Sever: 8 counts) create wide interruption windows. Fast spells (Force: 3 counts) are harder to disrupt.
- Protecting your caster while they cast is a real tactical role.
- (PW + 4) × 10 means a PW +3 caster holds concentration 70% of the time — dependable but never safe. A PW +1 caster at 50% is a coin flip. Casting in the open during a fight is always risky.

---

## 8. Range & Positioning (Theater of the Mind)

No grid, no measurements. Distances are described in **narrative range bands:**

| Band | Description | Means |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Close** | Within arm's reach | Melee range. Can touch, grapple, stab |
| **Near** | A few steps away, same room | Can close to melee in 1 count (free move). Ranged attacks at no penalty |
| **Far** | Across a large room, down a street | Ranged attacks at -10% (unless Accurate). Closing takes a Sprint (speed 3) to reach Near |
| **Distant** | Across a field, rooftop to street | Only Accurate ranged weapons and rifles. -20%. Multiple sprints to close |

**Movement:** Moving within Near range is free (folded into your action). Closing from Far to Near or retreating from Near to Far costs a **Sprint** (speed 3 action on the timing track). You can attack and move in the same action only if you start Near and close to Close — the final step is part of the attack.

**Cover:** Part of the scene description, not a movement action. The GM establishes what cover exists. Taking Cover (speed 2) moves you behind something nearby. Partial cover: -10% for attackers to hit you. Heavy cover: -20%.

**Scatter tag interaction:** Shotguns and scatter weapons deal +1d6 at Close range, -1d6 at Far range.

---

## 9. Healing & Recovery

### 9.1 In Combat

**Medicine skill check (speed 5):** Stabilize a Dying character (see §5.3). Can also be used to perform field treatment on a wounded ally — success restores 1d4 HP. One Medicine check per patient per scene.

**Mend spell:** Heals per the spell's tier table. Casting time and exhaustion costs apply normally. Healing in combat means your healer is spending counts casting instead of fighting — and generating Magic Accumulation.

**Potions/vials (speed 3):** If the setting includes healing potions, drinking one takes 3 counts and must be in-hand.

### 9.2 After Combat

**Short rest (minutes):** Catch your breath, bandage wounds. Medicine check on each wounded character: success restores 1d4 HP per wound tier entered. One check per character.

**Full rest (hours):**
- **Physical damage:** Recover 1d4 HP per hour of full rest.
- **Exhaustion:** Recover 1d8 EP per hour of full rest.
- **Medical treatment bonus:** A character receiving care from someone with Medicine skill recovers an additional 1d4 HP per hour.

### 9.3 Armor Repair

Degraded armor can be repaired with a **Metalworking check** (or Repair for modern/exotic armor) and appropriate tools/materials. This is a downtime activity, not a combat action. GM sets difficulty based on the extent of damage.

---

## 10. Combat Round Example

> **Setup:** Two PCs (Kael, a swordsman with PC +2, and Sera, a wild caster with PC +0) face two thugs with revolvers (PC +0, AW -1) in an alley. No prior Magic Accumulation.

**Count 0 — Declarations (first round, all simultaneous):**
- Kael: draws his Medium sword (speed 2, token at 2)
- Sera: begins casting Force (fixed casting time 3, token at 3)
- Thug A: fires revolver at Kael (speed 3, token at 3)
- Thug B: fires revolver at Sera (speed 3, token at 3)

**Count 2 — Kael's draw resolves.** Sword is ready. He declares a melee attack on Thug A (Medium speed 5, token at 7). He needs to close from Near — the final step is part of his attack (he's Near, closing to Close is free).

**Count 3 — Three tokens resolve.** All three started at count 0, so they resolve simultaneously.
- **Sera's Force spell:** Rolls d100 against casting target 55. Rolls 38 — success, margin 17 → Standard tier. She's a wild caster — she rides the surge, no choice. Targets Thug B. Deals 2d6 = 8 damage. Sera pays 4 exhaustion from her EP track. Backlash check: 10% chance, rolls 67 — no backlash. Magic Accumulation in the area: +2.
- **Thug A fires at Kael:** Rolls 44 against skill 50. Hit. Damage: 2d6 = 9. Kael is wearing leather (Soak 2). 9 − 2 = 7 damage. Armor degradation check: 9 exceeds Soak 2, so roll — 63, no degradation. Kael has 9 HP per tier (PP +2). He takes 7 into his OK tier, leaving 2 HP before Harmed. Close call.
- **Thug B fires at Sera:** Rolls 71 against skill 50. Miss. No malfunction check needed — there was 0 accumulation when the shot was declared (accumulation from Sera's spell and the shot resolve simultaneously on this count).

**Post-count 3:** Area now has 2 Magic Accumulation. Both revolvers (Reliability 95) drop to effective 89 — barely noticeable, but the clock is ticking.

**Count 3 — New declarations (declaration order matters now):**
Three characters need to declare: Sera (PC +0), Thug A (PC +0, AW -1), Thug B (PC +0, AW -1). Thugs declare first (tied PC, lower AW). Then Sera. Sera gets to see what both thugs are committing to before she decides.
- Thug A: fires again at Kael (speed 3, token at 6). Malfunction check required — accumulation is now 2.
- Thug B: took 8 damage. HP per tier is 7 (PP +0). 7 fills OK, 1 overflows to Harmed. He's at -10%. Fires at Sera (speed 3, token at 6, skill now 40 after penalty).
- Sera: sees both thugs shooting again. Casts Force again (casting time 3, token at 6).

*Note: Kael doesn't declare here — his sword attack is already on the track at count 7.*

**Count 6 — Three tokens resolve.**
- **Sera's Force:** Rolls 29 against 55. Hit, margin 26 → Standard again. Wild caster — takes it. Targets Thug A. Deals 2d6 = 7. Backlash check: rolls 03 — backlash! 1d4 = 2 physical damage to Sera. Then 25% Wild Effect check: rolls 41 — no wild effect. Accumulation climbs to +4 total.
- **Thug A at Kael:** Rolls 61 against skill 50. Miss. Also over effective Reliability 89? 61 is under 89, so no malfunction. Clean miss.
- **Thug B at Sera:** Rolls 55 against skill 40 (after -10% wound penalty). Miss. Over effective Reliability 89? 55 is under 89. Clean miss.

**Count 6 — New declarations (declaration order):**
Thugs (PC +0, AW -1) declare first. Then Sera (PC +0, AW +1). Kael (PC +2) isn't declaring — his attack resolves next count.
- Thug A: took 7 damage. HP per tier 7 — exactly fills OK. He's at the edge of Harmed. Fires at Kael (speed 3, token at 9).
- Thug B: fires at Sera (speed 3, token at 9, skill still 40).
- Sera: sees both thugs targeting the same people. Decides to cast Force a third time (token at 9). Accumulation will be climbing...

**Count 7 — Kael's sword resolves.** Rolls 22 against Melee target 65. Hit, margin 43 — check crit range. Skill 65, crit range = 2 (65 is in the 51-75 bracket). Crits on 63-65. Rolled 22, not a crit. Damage: 1d8+1 = 7. Thug A has no armor. 7 fills OK tier exactly — he's now at the boundary of Harmed.

**Count 7 — Kael declares.** He's the last to declare (highest PC). Thug A is right in front of him, reeling. Sera and both thugs have tokens at count 9. Kael swings again — Medium speed 5, token at count 12. He'll hit after the next exchange resolves.

**Post-count 7:** Kael is in melee with Thug A. Sera has taken 2 backlash damage. Thugs are both wounded. Accumulation at 4 (effective Reliability 83). The revolvers still work, but Sera's third Force spell will push it to 6-8 depending on tier — things are getting dicey for the firearms.

## 12. One-Page Combat Cheat Sheet

```
COMBAT FLOW
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
1. GM sets scene → range bands, cover, lighting
2. All declare actions simultaneously
3. Place tokens: current count + action speed
4. Advance track → resolve tokens in order
5. Repeat from step 2 after resolution

ATTACK: d100 ≤ skill target = hit
  Crit range: 1pt per 25% of skill, counted down from skill value
  00 = always fumble │ 01 = always crit │ Crit = double damage dice

ACTIVE DEFENSE: opposed check vs attacker's margin
  Cost: +2 speed on next action │ 1 per count │ Can't defend mid-action

DAMAGE: roll dice → subtract armor Soak → apply to HP
  Degradation: damage > Soak? Flat 25% chance, lose 1 Soak (Crushing: 50%)

MALFUNCTION: d100 > effective Reliability = malfunction
  Eff. Reliability = Base − (Magic Accumulation × 3)
  Severity: d10 → 1-5 click, 6-7 jam, 8 misfire, 9 broken, 10 boom

WOUNDS          EXHAUSTION          RANGE BANDS
OK: —           OK: —               Close: melee
Harmed: -10%    Weakened: -10%      Near: same room
Maimed: -25%    Sev. Weak: -25%     Far: -10% ranged
Incap: -50%     Incap: -50%         Distant: -20%, rifles only
                Penalties STACK

DYING: every 3 counts, d100 → over 50 = fail → 3 fails = dead
  01 = stabilize │ 00 = instant death │ Medicine (spd 5) stabilizes
  Fastest death: 9 counts │ Typical: 12-18 counts

CASTING: fixed speed per spell (not per tier)
  Tier = power drawn, not time │ Scholarly restrict down, Wild ride it out
  Cancel: half Weak tier cost, 10% backlash │ Concentration: (PW+4)×10

DECLARATION ORDER (same-count): lowest PC declares first, ties by AW
  Better stats = declare last = see what opponents commit to

ACCUMULATION: each spell adds tier value (W1/S2/St3/Sp4)
  Decays 1/minute │ Firearms degrade 3% per point

HINDER: -5% per point to PC/Athletics/Stealth/Swim
  +1 casting speed per point
```

## 13. Open Questions for Playtesting

1. **Active defense balance** — Is +2 speed cost enough? Too much? Should shields grant free defense once per round?
2. **Concentration check ((PW + 4) × 10)** — Range is 10% (PW -3) to 70% (PW +3). Does this properly reward PW investment at character creation?
3. **Death save threshold (50/50)** — Should PP modify the threshold? Should damage severity affect it? The 3-count interval feels right but the 50/50 split is arbitrary.
4. **One-roll vs. two-roll malfunction** — The sidebar suggests using the attack roll as the malfunction check too. Playtest both and see which feels better at the table.
5. **Firing into melee** — -10% and hitting allies on near-miss. Does this feel right or should it be harsher/softer?
6. **Active defense vs. ranged** — Can you dodge a bullet? Currently yes (Athletics). Should firearms be un-dodgeable, or is the +2 speed cost enough penalty for the narrative stretch?
7. **Hinder affecting casting speed** — Does +1-2 speed per Hinder point feel right, or should plate armor casters just not exist?
8. **Sprint speed (3)** — Does closing from Far to Near feel right at 3 counts? That's same speed as a revolver shot — you eat a bullet on the way in. Intentional?
9. **Accumulation tracking granularity** — Is per-spell tracking manageable at the table, or should it be simplified to "light/moderate/heavy casting" thresholds?
10. **Fixed casting times per spell** — Need to assign casting times to all 37 spells. Current examples: Force 3, Mend 5, Sever 8. What's the right range? 2-10 counts?
